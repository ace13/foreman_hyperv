# Foreman Hyper-V

[![Gem Version](https://badge.fury.io/rb/foreman_hyperv.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/rb/foreman_hyperv)

Microsoft Hyper-V compute resource for Foreman

Uses the in-development `fog-hyperv` gem found [here](https://github.com/ace13/fog-hyperv).

## Testing/Installing

Follow the Foreman manual for [advanced installation from gems](https://theforeman.org/plugins/#2.3AdvancedInstallationfromGems) for `fog-hyperv` and `foreman_hyperv`.

There are RPMs packaged for the `fog-hyperv` dependencies under [Release v0.0.1](https://github.com/ace13/foreman_hyperv/releases/tag/v0.0.1), or they too can be installed from gems.

Do bear in mind that this is still very early in development, so plenty of issues may exist.
